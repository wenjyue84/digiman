# Capsule Layout & Deck Numbering

## Deck System (Lower vs Upper)

- **Even-numbered capsules** (C2, C4, C6, C8, C10, C12, C14, C16, C18, C20, C22, C24, C26) = **Lower deck (bottom bunk)**
- **Odd-numbered capsules** (C1, C3, C5, C7, C9, C11, C13, C15, C17, C19, C21, C23, C25) = **Upper deck (top bunk)**
- Most guests prefer **lower deck** because it's easier to access (no climbing)

## Capsule Sections

| Section | Capsules | Location | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Back** | C1–C6 | Rear of hostel | Quietest area, preferred for female guests |
| **Front** | C11–C24 | Front of hostel | Larger section, general assignment |
| **Middle** | C25–C26 | Center area | Transition zone |

## Branches (NOT currently available)

- **J1–J4** and **R1–R6** are in a new branch and are NOT available for assignment yet
- Do NOT assign guests to J or R capsules

## Quick Reference Examples

- **C5** → Upper deck (top bunk), Back section
- **C4** → Lower deck (bottom bunk), Back section
- **C12** → Lower deck (bottom bunk), Front section
- **C11** → Upper deck (top bunk), Front section
- **C26** → Lower deck (bottom bunk), Middle section

## Assignment Priority

1. **Even-numbered capsules first** (lower deck preferred by most guests)
2. **Back section** preferred for female guests (C1–C6)
3. Capsules with active maintenance issues are deprioritized
4. J1–J4 and R1–R6 excluded (new branch, not available)
