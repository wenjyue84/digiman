# Memory Sync Round 5 Progress Log - Fri, Feb 21, 2026
Extracting facts from Notion workspace into Mem0 Cloud — Round 5 (Prisma Clients, Community Leadership & Digital Operations)
Starting Mem0 count: 1,397

## Patterns
- Use ToolSearch to load notion-search and notion-fetch before each iteration
- Push facts via python3 urllib.request with 0.3s sleep between calls
- Search Mem0 first to check for existing facts before pushing
- Mem0 deduplicates automatically — overlapping facts get merged
- Always add encoding='utf-8' to file operations on Windows
- Use ssl.create_default_context() for HTTPS calls
- Use "infer": false in POST body for synchronous direct memory addition

### Cumulative Totals Across All 5 Rounds
| Round | Stories | Raw Facts | Mem0 Start | Mem0 End | Net New |
|-------|---------|-----------|------------|----------|---------|
| Round 1 | 18 | ~180 | ~605 | ~819 | ~214 |
| Round 2 | 12 | ~120 | 819 | 975 | 156 |
| Round 3 | 10 | 101 | 975 | 1,127 | 152 |
| Round 4 | 10 | 99 | 1,127 | 1,397 | 270 |
| Round 5 | 10 | 100 | 1,397 | 1,497 | 100 |
| **Total** | **60** | **~600** | **605** | **1,497** | **892** |

### Technical Notes
- All 3 waves launched without waiting — maximum throughput per user's "nonstop" instruction
- No PRD race conditions in Round 5 (clean run, consistent with Round 4)
- Net new (+100) is lower than raw facts (100) — suggests Mem0 deduplication is catching overlaps with previous rounds (e.g., Prisma team details partially synced in Round 4)
- Round 5 focused on Prisma's extended client portfolio and community/personal domains missed in Rounds 1-4
