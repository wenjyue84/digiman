# Memory Sync Round 3 Progress Log - Thu, Feb 20, 2026
Extracting facts from Notion workspace into Mem0 Cloud — Round 3 (Business Operations, Travel & Financial)
Starting Mem0 count: 975

## Patterns
- Use ToolSearch to load notion-search and notion-fetch before each iteration
- Push facts via python3 urllib.request with 0.3s sleep between calls
- Search Mem0 first to check for existing facts before pushing
- Mem0 deduplicates automatically — overlapping facts get merged
- Always add encoding='utf-8' to file operations on Windows
- Use ssl.create_default_context() for HTTPS calls
- PRD path: C:/Users/Jyue/Documents/1-projects/Projects/PelangiManager-Zeabur/memory-sync-prd-3.json

### Technical Notes
- Mem0 Cloud now processes all POST /v1/memories/ asynchronously (returns PENDING)
- Using `"infer": false` forces synchronous direct memory addition for immediate confirmation
- PRD race condition: When multiple agents write to same PRD file, later writes can revert earlier ones — always reconcile post-wave
