# Memory Sync Round 6 Progress Log - Fri, Feb 21, 2026
Extracting facts from Notion workspace into Mem0 Cloud — Round 6 (Arising, Government Grants, Interns, Coaching & Commercial Properties)
Starting Mem0 count: 1,497

## Patterns
- Use ToolSearch to load notion-search and notion-fetch before each iteration
- Push facts via python3 urllib.request with 0.3s sleep between calls
- Search Mem0 first to check for existing facts before pushing
- Mem0 deduplicates automatically — overlapping facts get merged
- Always add encoding='utf-8' to file operations on Windows
- Use ssl.create_default_context() for HTTPS calls
- Use "infer": false in POST body for synchronous direct memory addition

- Sensitive data (salary amounts, bank accounts, NRIC) excluded from staff operations facts
- Round 6 completed the deepest coverage yet: personal biography, commercial property transactions, government grants pipeline, intern pipeline, and multilingual learning journey
